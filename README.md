- [`PowerValidatedSolutions`][module-powervalidatedsolutions] 2.2.0 or later

## Installing the Module

Verify that your system has a supported edition and version of PowerShell installed.

Install the supporting PowerShell modules from the PowerShell Gallery by running the following commands:

```powershell
Set-PSRepository -Name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -MinimumVersion 13.0.0
Install-Module -Name VMware.vSphere.SsoAdmin -MinimumVersion 1.3.9
Install-Module -Name PowerVCF -MinimumVersion 2.3.0
Install-Module -Name PowerValidatedSolutions -MinimumVersion 2.2.0
Install-Module -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement
```

If using PowerShell Core, import the modules before proceeding:

For example:

```powershell
Import-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI
Import-Module -Name VMware.vSphere.SsoAdmin
Import-Module -Name PowerVCF
Import-Module -Name PowerValidatedSolutions
Import-Module -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement
```

Once installed, any cmdlets associated with `VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement` and the supporting PowerShell modules will be available for use.

To view the cmdlets for available in the module, run the following command in the PowerShell console.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement
```

To view the help for any cmdlet, run the `Get-Help` command in the PowerShell console.

For example:

```powershell
Get-Help -Name <cmdlet-name>
```

```powershell
Get-Help -Name <cmdlet-name> -Examples
```

## Updating the Module

Update the PowerShell module from the PowerShell Gallery by running the following commands:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement
```

To verify that the PowerShell module is updated, run the following command in the PowerShell console.

```powershell
Get-InstalledModule -Name VMware.CloudFoundation.CertificateManagement
```

## User Access

Each cmdlet may provide one or more usage examples. Many of the cmdlets require that credentials are provided to output to the PowerShell console or a report.

The cmdlets in this module, and its dependencies, return data from multple platform components. The credentials for most of the platform components are returned to the cmdlets by retrieving credentials from the SDDC Manager inventory and using these credentials, as needed, within cmdlet operations.

For the best expereince, for cmdlets that connect to SDDC Manager, use the VMware Cloud Foundation API user `admin@local` or an account with the **ADMIN** role in SDDC Manager (e.g., `administrator@vsphere.local`).

## Getting Started with Certificate Management

The PowerShell module provides the ability to perform the following operations:

- [Set the ESXi Certificate Mode in vCenter Server](#set-the-esxi-certificate-mode-in-vcenter-server)
- [Request a Certificate Signing Request](#request-a-certificate-signing-request)
- [Verify the Certificate Authority is Trusted in vCenter Server](#verify-the-certificate-authority-is-trusted-in-vcenter-server)
- [Set the Lockdown Mode for ESXi Hosts](#set-the-lockdown-mode-for-esxi-hosts)
- [Get the vSAN Health Summary from vCenter Server for a Cluster](#get-the-vsan-health-summary-from-vcenter-server-for-a-cluster)
- [Install a Certificate](#install-a-certificate)

Refer to [/docs/functions](/docs/functions) for all available functions.

### Set the ESXi Certificate Mode in vCenter Server

The [`Set-EsxiCertificateMode`](/docs/functions/Set-EsxiCertificateMode.md) cmdlet sets the certificate management mode in vCenter Server for the ESXi hosts in a workload domain.

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $mode = "custom"
    ```
3. Set the ESXi certificate management mode in vCenter Server by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Set-EsxiCertificateMode -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -mode $mode
    ```

### Request a Certificate Signing Request

The [`Request-EsxiCsr`](/docs/functions/Request-EsxiCsr.md) cmdlet will generate the Certificate Signing Request for ESXi host(s) and saves it to file(s) in an output directory. 

#### Request Certificate Signing Request files for All ESXi Hosts in a Cluster 

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $cluster = "sfo-m01-cl01"
    $country = "US"
    $locality = "San Francisco"
    $organization = "Rainpole"
    $organizationUnit = "VCF"
    $stateOrProvince = "CA"
    $outputDirectory = "F:\csr"
    ```
3. Request Certificate Signing Request files by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Request-EsxiCsr -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -cluster $cluster -Country $country -Locality $location -Organization $organization -OrganizationUnit $organizationUnit -StateOrProvince $stateOrProvince -outputFolder $outputDirectory
    ```

#### Request a Certificate Signing Request file for an ESXi Host

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $esxiFqdn = "sfo01-m01-esx01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $country = "US"
    $locality = "San Francisco"
    $organization = "Rainpole"
    $organizationUnit = "VCF"
    $stateOrProvince = "CA"
    $outputDirectory = "F:\csr"
    ```
3. Request a Certificate Signing Request file by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Request-EsxiCsr -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -esxiFqdn $esxiFqdn -Country $country -Locality $location -Organization $organization -OrganizationUnit $organizationUnit -StateOrProvince $stateOrProvince -outputFolder $outputDirectory
    ```

### Verify the Certificate Authority is Trusted in vCenter Server

The [`Confirm-CAInvCenterServer`](/docs/functions/Confirm-CAInvCenterServer.md) cmdlet gets the thumbprint from the root certificate and matches it with the CA thumbprint from the vCenter Server instance. You need to pass in the complete path for the certificate file. Returns true if thumbprint matches, else returns false.

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $issuer = "rainpole"
    $signedCertificate = "F:\certificates\Root64.cer"
    ```
3. Verify the Certificate Authority is trusted in vCenter server by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Confirm-CAInvCenterServer -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -issuer $issuer -signedCertificate $signedCertificate
    ```

### Set the Lockdown Mode for ESXi Hosts

The [`Set-ESXiLockdownMode`](/docs/functions/Set-ESXiLockdownMode.md) cmdlet sets the lockdown mode for all ESXi hosts in a given cluster.

#### Set the Lockdown Mode to Disable for ESXi Hosts

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $cluster = "sfo-m01-cl01"
    ```
3. Set the lockdown mode to `disable` by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Set-ESXiLockdownMode -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -cluster $cluster -disable
    ```

#### Set the Lockdown Mode to Enable for ESXi Hosts

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $cluster = "sfo-m01-cl01"
    ```
3. Set the lockdown mode to `enable` by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Set-ESXiLockdownMode -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -cluster $cluster -enable
    ```

### Get the vSAN Health Summary from vCenter Server for a Cluster

The [`Get-vSANHealthSummary`](/docs/functions/Get-vSANHealthSummary.md) cmdlet gets the vSAN health summary from vCenter Server for a cluster. If any status is YELLOW or RED, a WARNING or ERROR will be raised.

1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $cluster = "sfo-m01-cl01"
    ```
3. Get the vSAN health summary from vCenter server for a cluster by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Get-vSANHealthSummary -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -password $sddcManagerPass -domain $workloadDomain -cluster $cluster
    ```

### Install a Certificate

The [`Install-EsxiCertificate`](/docs/functions/Install-EsxiCertificate.md) cmdlet will replace the certificate for an ESXi host or for each ESXi host in a cluster. You must provide the directory containing the signed certificate files. Certificate names should be in format <FQDN>.crt e.g. sfo01-m01-esx01.sfo.rainpole.io.crt. The workflow will put the ESXi host in maintenance mode (with full data migration for vSAN only), disconnect the ESXi host from the vCenter Server, replace the certificate, restart the ESXi host, and the exit maintenance mode once the ESXi host is online.

#### Install a Certificate to each ESXi Host in a Cluster
  
1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $cluster = "sfo-m01-cl01"
    $certificateDirectory = "F:\certificates"
    $certificateFileExt = ".cer"
    ```
3. Install a Certificate for each ESXi host in cluster by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Install-EsxiCertificate -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -pass $sddcManagerPass -domain $domain -cluster $cluster -certificateDirectory $certificateDirectory -certificateFileExt $certificateFileExt
    ```

#### Install a Certificate to an ESXi Host
  
1. Start PowerShell (Run as Administrator).

2. Replace the values in the sample code with values for the instance of VMware Cloud Foundation and run the commands in the PowerShell console.

    **Example**: 

    ```powershell
    $sddcManagerFqdn = "sfo-vcf01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $sddcManagerUser = "administrator@vsphere.local"
    $sddcManagerPass = "VMw@re1!"
    $workloadDomain = "sfo-m01"
    $esxiFqdn = "sfo01-m01-esx01.sfo.rainpole.io"
    $certificateDirectory = "F:\certificates"
    $certificateFileExt = ".cer"
    ```
3. Install a certificate to an ESXi host by running the command in the PowerShell console.

    ```powershell
    Install-EsxiCertificate -server $sddcManagerFqdn -user $sddcManagerUser -pass $sddcManagerPass -domain $domain -esxiFqdn $esxiFqdn -certificateDirectory $certificateDirectory -certificateFileExt $certificateFileExt
